            <p class="project-title">CI/CD Pipeline Project @College</p>
            <p class="project-description"><b>Title:</b>Implemented a three-tier application CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and deployed on staging and production environments based on branch changes.</p>
            <p class="Repository Link"><a href="https://github.com/Mayankthukral/3-tier-app-CI-CD" target="_blank">https://github.com/Mayankthukral/3-tier-app-CI-CD</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines, automating end-to-end CI/CD processes, and reducing deployment errors.</li>
        <li>Stored secrets and passwords used in the workflow securely in GitHub Secrets.</li>
        <li>Created pipeline steps to run unit tests on decoupled frontend and backend services connected to MongoDB Atlas, followed by Sonar scanner analysis to generate reports on SonarCloud. After these checks, dockerized both services and pushed them to the container registry.</li>
        <li>Implemented separate deployments: if changes were pushed to the testing branch, the staging cluster was provisioned and updated; if changes were made in the master branch, the production cluster was provisioned and updated.</li>
        <li>For each distinct environment, provisioned a Kubernetes cluster or made necessary adjustments using Terraform Cloud, ensuring that the state file was locked during infrastructure changes. Installed an Nginx ingress controller to expose the front-end service, enabling external access. Subsequently, applied all required deployments within the cluster, ensuring the smooth functioning of backend and frontend services. Finally, set up Prometheus and Grafana for continuous monitoring, allowing for real-time performance tracking and system health assessment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Technologies used: </b>GitHub Actions, MERN stack, Docker, Docker Hub, Terraform Cloud, Azure Kubernetes Service, GitHub Secrets, Prometheus, and Grafana.</p>

    <p><b>Outcome: </b>Streamlined development workflows, scalable Kubernetes infrastructure, and comprehensive monitoring for enhanced deployment efficiency and application performance.</p>
